Step 1: Recipe Embeddings
Set up vector database (Pinecone/Chroma)
Create embedding generation pipeline:
Use LangChain to generate embeddings from recipe content
Store recipe metadata with embeddings
Create a system to update embeddings when recipes change
Step 2: Celery Setup
Install and configure Celery
Set up Redis as message broker
Create Celery tasks for:
Processing new recipes
Updating user profiles
Periodic profile updates
Step 3: User Profile System
Create profile models:
Taste preferences
Dietary restrictions
Cooking skill level
Favorite cuisines
Set up profile update tasks:
Analyze saved recipes
Update preferences
Track changes over time
Step 4: Taste Profile System
Create taste profile models:
Flavor preferences
Ingredient preferences
Cooking style preferences
Implement preference analysis:
Analyze recipe patterns
Update taste profiles
Track changes
Step 5: Recommendation System
Implement vector similarity search
Create recommendation engine:
Match user preferences
Consider dietary restrictions
Factor in cooking skill level


Recipe Embedding on Save:
When a user saves a recipe, we'll automatically generate and store its embedding
This will happen in the recipe creation/update view
We'll use the embedding functions we just tested
Each recipe will be associated with the user who created it
User Profile and Food Preferences:
Create a user profile model to store:
Dietary preferences
Allergies
Favorite cuisines
Cooking skill level
These will be used to filter and recommend recipes
Celery Worker for Profile Updates:
Create a background task to:
Analyze user's saved recipes
Update their food preferences
Generate personalized recommendations
This will run periodically or when new recipes are saved
Recipe Recommendations:
Use the embeddings to find similar recipes
Filter based on user preferences
Consider dietary restrictions
Show personalized recommendations
The flow would be:
User Saves Recipe
    ↓
Generate & Store Embedding
    ↓
Update User's Recipe Collection
    ↓
Trigger Celery Task
    ↓
Analyze User's Recipes
    ↓
Update User Profile & Preferences
    ↓
Generate New Recommendations
