Phase 1: Celery & Redis Setup
First, we'll verify the Celery and Redis setup in your Django project
Create a Celery configuration file
Set up a basic test task to ensure everything is working
Test the connection between Django, Celery, and Redis
Phase 2: Recipe Embedding Storage
Create a model to store recipe embeddings (if not already present)
Create a model to store user embeddings
Create a model to store user recommendations
Phase 3: Celery Task Implementation
Create a Celery task for calculating user embeddings
Create a Celery task for generating recommendations
Implement the cosine similarity calculation
Test the tasks independently
Phase 4: Integration with Recipe Saving
Modify the recipe saving view to trigger the Celery task
Implement the logic to update user embeddings when a recipe is saved
Test the end-to-end flow
Phase 5: Frontend Implementation
Add a new "Recommendations" tab in the sidebar
Create a new Vue component for displaying recommendations
Implement the API endpoint to fetch recommendations
Add the frontend logic to display recommendations
Phase 6: Testing & Optimization
Test the recommendation system with different user scenarios
Optimize the embedding calculations
Add caching if needed
Implement error handling
