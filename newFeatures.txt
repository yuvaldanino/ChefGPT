- basically made a bunch of the backend 


to do:
- when we text we shouldnt auto scroll to button of message 
- make it so you can share recipes, then theyre displayed on the social page which has liked and dislikes. like 
    with this users can share recipes and this becomes like a social media for cookign also 
    - in social media app. if you see a recipe you like. you can click open recipe in chat
            this open the recipe in a chat for you and makes it so you can ask stuff about the current recipe 
- add voice bot capabilities so you can talk to send messages 
- mayeb change to better model for fasted responded and better shit 
- make something that can suggest receipes to you based on the recipes you make usually 
- maybe we can add calorie tracking to this?
